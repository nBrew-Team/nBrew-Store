# nBrew-Store
An open source 3DS homebrew store based on Universal-Updater.

Setting up your enviromment
To build nBrew Store from source, you will need to setup devkitARM with libctru and 3ds-curl. Follow devkitPro's Getting Started page to install pacman, then run (sudo dkp-)pacman -S 3ds-dev 3ds-curl. You will also need bannertool and makerom in your PATH. Once you clone the repo (and its submodules), simply run make in the source code directory.
